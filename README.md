# üéõÔ∏è FM Engine (working title), formerly Voltage Phase Module (Juce 8.07)

> **A modular FM engine designed as a delay with advanced audio-rate modulation, inspired by classic FM synthesis but focused on creative signal processing.**

## üìù Overview

I'm working on a **Juce 8.07 plugin** featuring a well-defined `Delay.cpp` designed as an FM engine.  
This module implements just the FM part typically found in an FM synthesizer‚Äî**no actual sound generation** is performed here.

The delay line uses **cubic interpolation** for smooth transitions in delay time, which is standard for time-modulated effects.

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Technical Highlights

- **Oversampling:**  
  Currently using JUCE's built-in oversampling. The next step is to implement a SIMD version for greater efficiency (JUCE may include SIMD tools for this purpose).
- **Audio-rate Time Modulation:**  
  The delay is modulated at audio rate by the amplitude of a sidechain signal. This can introduce noise with complex waveforms, so oversampling is key to maximizing useful signal.

## üìö Background

> [Original article about this plugin (2014, Bedroom Producers Blog)](https://bedroomproducersblog.com/2014/06/18/voltage-phase-module/)

The plugin‚Äôs name is technically incorrect‚Äîoriginally, I thought it was doing phase modulation, but it‚Äôs actually **frequency modulation**. I'm working on correcting this in the project and documentation.

## üîÄ Signal Flow (todo: fix this graph)

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[stereo and sidechain] --> B[Routing.cpp]
    B --> C[car L, car R, mod L, mod R]
    C --> D[out L]
    C --> E[out R]
```

**Processing equations:**

```cpp
out L = DelayL(carrier L, maxDelayLength * lowpass(atan(clipper(mod L signal + 1) * 0.5)))
out R = DelayR(carrier R, maxDelayLength * lowpass(atan(clipper(mod R signal + 1) * 0.5)))
```

- Take a **bipolar audio signal**, add 1 to make it unipolar, then scale/normalize to 0‚Äì1.
- Use this as a multiplier for the maximum delay length, modulating at audio rate.

## üéõÔ∏è Controls

- **Second Knob:**  
  Acts as a coarse range control, reporting PDC (lookahead or pre-delay) to the DAW.  
  *Not* intended for automation or frequent adjustment.
- **Leftmost Dial:**  
  Designed for automation or manual tweaking.

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Notes

- The core FM engine is in `Delay.cpp`.
- Delay time is **cubic interpolated** for smooth modulation.
- **SIMD optimization** is a future goal for oversampling.
- The current modulation scheme can create noise with program material, so maximizing signal quality is a key focus.

## üì¢ Feedback & Contributions

- Suggestions for improving the oversampling or SIMD implementation are welcome!
- If you have experience with audio-rate delay modulation or FM techniques, please open an issue or PR.
