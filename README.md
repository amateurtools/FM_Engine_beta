## üöÄ Overview

Think of FM Engine as *just* the FM part of an FM synthesizer. Except it allows the oft dreamt of
applying FM to any two sources, using one as the carrier and one as the modulator. 
Smooth sine shaped modulators sound better, but it can be used in as many ways as you can
imagine. Obviously if you use modulators that contain high frequencies or noise it will just
result in noise, so there's a built in low pass filter. However, try feeding it two different
sine synths, or playing with a single sine synth in mode 1 and play a chord.

### ‚ú® Key Features

- **üìà Advanced Oversampling** - JUCE built-in with planned SIMD optimization
- **üéõÔ∏è Flexible Routing** - Three algorithms supporting mono to full stereo processing
- **‚ö° Low Latency** - Precise PDC (Plugin Delay Compensation) support
- **üîä Multiple Interpolation** - Linear and Lagrange cubic interpolation

## üìä Technical Specifications

### Core Parameters

| Parameter | Range | Default | Description |
|-----------|-------|---------|-------------|
| **Modulation Depth** | 0.0 - 1.0 | 0.0 | Controls FM intensity with 0.5 skew |
| **Max Delay Range** | 10ms/100ms/1000ms | 100ms | Maximum delay time range |
| **Algorithm** | 0-2 | 0 | Routing algorithm selection |
| **Invert** | On/Off | Off | Swaps carrier and modulator |
| **Lowpass Cutoff** | 30Hz - 20kHz | 20kHz | Modulator filtering (log scale) |
| **PDC** | On/Off | Off | Plugin Delay Compensation |
| **Interpolation** | Linear/Lagrange | Linear | Delay line interpolation type |
| **Oversampling** | On/Off | Off | 2x oversampling for quality |

### Processing Equations

The core delay modulation follows these equations:

```
out_L = DelayL(carrier_L, maxDelayLength √ó lowpass(atan(clipper(modulator_L + 1) √ó 0.5)))
out_R = DelayR(carrier_R, maxDelayLength √ó lowpass(atan(clipper(modulator_R + 1) √ó 0.5)))
```

## üîß Building & Installation

### Prerequisites

- **JUCE Framework** 8.07 or higher
- **C++17** compatible compiler
- **CMake** 3.15+ (for CMake builds) or **Projucer**

### Build Instructions

#### Using Projucer
1. Open `FM_Engine.jucer` in Projucer
2. Configure your target IDE/build system
3. Export and build in your IDE

#### Using CMake
```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
make -j$(nproc)
```

### Installation
1. Copy the built VST3 to your plugin directory:
   - **Windows:** `C:\Program Files\Common Files\VST3\`
   - **macOS:** `~/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/VST3/`
   - **Linux:** `~/.vst3/`

## üéµ Usage Examples

### Creative Applications

1. **Self-Modulating Instruments**
   - Route piano ‚Üí Algorithm 0 ‚Üí Use velocity as modulator
   - Creates dynamic FM textures based on playing dynamics

2. **Sidechain FM Effects**
   - Main: Vocal, Sidechain: Kick drum
   - Algorithm 2 for stereo sidechain modulation
   - Rhythmic vocal texturing

3. **Stereo Image Manipulation**
   - Algorithm 2 with independent L/R sidechain sources
   - Creates complex stereo movement and spatial effects

### Parameter Automation Tips

- **Modulation Depth**: Automate for dramatic build-ups
- **Max Delay Range**: Switch between ranges for different effects
- **Algorithm**: Real-time routing changes for arrangement dynamics
- **Lowpass Cutoff**: Filter sweeps on the modulator signal

## üî¨ Technical Deep Dive

### Delay Line Implementation

The `InterpolatedDelay` class features:

- **Circular Buffer**: Efficient memory usage with wraparound
- **Lagrange Interpolation**: 3rd-order polynomial for smooth delays
- **Oversampling Support**: Handles 2x oversampled processing
- **PDC Integration**: Bipolar modulation for advanced timing control

### Routing System

The `routeSample()` function implements three distinct algorithms:

```cpp
// Algorithm 0: Mono Carrier/Modulator
carrier = {L, L}, modulator = {R, R}

// Algorithm 1: Mono Mix
carrier = {(L+R)/2, (L+R)/2}, modulator = {(SC_L+SC_R)/2, (SC_L+SC_R)/2}

// Algorithm 2: Full Stereo  
carrier = {L, R}, modulator = {SC_L, SC_R}
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**No Sidechain Input**
- Ensure your DAW supports sidechain routing
- Check that the sidechain bus is enabled in your DAW
- Verify Algorithm 1 or 2 is selected for sidechain processing

**High CPU Usage**
- Disable oversampling if not needed
- Use Linear interpolation instead of Lagrange
- Reduce the maximum delay range

**Artifacts/Clicking**
- Enable oversampling for complex program material
- Adjust the lowpass cutoff to filter high-frequency modulation
- Check that input levels aren't clipping the modulator

## üìö Background & History

FM Engine evolved from the original **Voltage Phase Module** concept, first documented in a 2014 [Bedroom Producers Blog article](https://bedroomproducersblog.com/2014/06/18/voltage-phase-module/). The project has undergone significant development:

- **2014**: Initial phase modulation concept
- **2024**: Realization that the effect is actually frequency modulation
- **2025**: Complete rewrite with JUCE 8.07 and modern architecture

The name change from "Voltage Phase Module" to "FM Engine" reflects the correct understanding of the underlying DSP principles.
