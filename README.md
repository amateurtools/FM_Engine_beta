üéõÔ∏è FM Engine (Working Title)

formerly Voltage Phase Module ‚Äì Built with JUCE 8.07

    A modular FM engine conceived as a delay effect with advanced audio-rate modulation. Inspired by classic FM synthesis, but focused on creative signal processing for modern production.
    Audio Demo: Piano modulating itself, then with Sine waves

üìù Overview

FM Engine is a JUCE 8.07 plugin module centered on a robust, modular delay line (Delay.cpp) designed for audio-rate frequency modulation. Unlike traditional FM synths, this module does not generate sound directly; instead, it processes incoming audio, enabling deep creative effects for instruments, vocals, or any source.

    Delay line: Uses cubic interpolation for smooth, time-modulated effects.

    FM Focus: Implements only the frequency modulation section of classic FM synths‚Äîno oscillators or direct sound generation.

‚ö°Ô∏è Technical Highlights

    Oversampling:
    Employs JUCE‚Äôs built-in oversampling. Plans are underway to implement SIMD-based oversampling for improved efficiency and fidelity.

    Audio-Rate Time Modulation:
    Delay time is modulated at audio rate by a sidechain amplitude signal. Oversampling is crucial to minimize noise when processing complex program material.

    Latency & PDC:
    The plugin supports precise latency reporting and lookahead (PDC), with controls designed for both automation and manual adjustment

üìö Background

    Original article (2014, Bedroom Producers Blog)

The project‚Äôs name has evolved: originally thought to be phase modulation, it is correctly frequency modulation. Documentation and code are being updated to reflect this.
üîÄ Signal Flow

text
graph TD
    A[stereo + sidechain] --> B[Routing.cpp]
    B --> C[car L, car R, mod L, mod R]
    C --> D[out L]
    C --> E[out R]

Processing equations:

cpp
out L = DelayL(carrier L, maxDelayLength * lowpass(atan(clipper(mod L signal + 1) * 0.5)))
out R = DelayR(carrier R, maxDelayLength * lowpass(atan(clipper(mod R signal + 1) * 0.5)))

    Modulation: Bipolar audio signal is shifted to unipolar, scaled 0‚Äì1, and used to modulate delay time at audio rate.

üéöÔ∏è Controls

    Second Knob:
    Coarse range control, manages plugin delay compensation (PDC). Not intended for frequent automation.

    Leftmost Dial:
    Designed for real-time automation or manual tweaking.

üõ†Ô∏è Development Notes

    Core FM processing is in Delay.cpp.

    Delay time is cubic-interpolated for smooth, high-quality modulation.

    SIMD optimization for oversampling is a key future goal.

    Focus on minimizing noise and maximizing signal quality during audio-rate modulation

Custom UI controls are being developed for intuitive user interaction
